## My process
I wrote the html code first, importing the image and then arranging the text layout. I then moved on to style the larger container and finally i style in smaller container containing the image and texts.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
 <h3>Improve your front-end  <br>
skills by building projects </h3>
            
```css
.container div{
    font-family: 'outfit', sans-serif;
    background-color:white;
    font-size: 15px;
    font-family: outfit;
    width: fit-content;
    height: fit-content;
    text-align: center;
    margin: 50px;
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px;
    box-shadow:0px 2px 20px rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.384)
}


### Continued development

Moving forward in future projects, i would like to focus
on projects that would enable me gain experiencee
and become grounded using css and its tools. Also, i would
like to pick up projects that would enable me learn responsive design seeing as i am not so familiar with the concept.


### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me in a few areas i got stuck eg how to import fonts in your css/html file. It also taught me the different methods of importation.
- [Google fonts](https://www.googlefonts.com) - This was an essential for the project. Howbeit, i learnt about the availability of different fonts and how to use them.
